# Keras Image Classifier Flask App Project
 
## Deep Learning Image Classification

## Implementation Details

The code is implemented using the keras library with tensorflow backend in python.There are three .py files, ahtml file and a .h5 file.
catVSdog.py file train the model and save it as catVSdog_Model.h5 and second file,PredictImage.py file load the .h5 file and predict a file,which is a cat or dog.

Last part is implementation of the code as Flask Image Classifier using .h5 model.
